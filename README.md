Topic: Optimization of wells and roads to maximize oil production

Problem: The currently publicly available solutions to the problem of the optimal location of oil wells rely mainly on the volume of oil production, but do not consider the location of wells relative to geographical objects and technical restrictions on their location and construction. For instance, such solutions do not consider hard-to-reach points for the construction, shape and location of technical roads.

Purpose of study: Development and analysis of a joint optimizing algorithm for the location of wells and roads in the field, considering geographically inaccessible areas.

Objectives of study: \n
1)Literature review of the optimizing of well placement topic. \n
2)Finding open data of oil fields. \n
3)The evolutionary algorithm development for well placement optimizing. \n
4)The evolutionary algorithm development for roads placement optimizing. \n
5)Development of joint algorithm based on previous ones. \n
6)Effectiveness analysis of joint algorithm: convergence analysis and comparing the results with sequential algorithm of separately using points 3 and 4.
